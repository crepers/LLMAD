There are no sudden changes, shifts, spikes, or dips in the value of `param1`. The machine's stage changes twice within this period (from Stage=8 to Stage=7, then back to Stage=8), but the `param1` reading itself is unaffected and remains at '0'. This consistent value, even with stage changes, aligns with a stable or idle state for this particular parameter, and does not indicate any overarching anomalous pattern in `param1`.\n",

      "2.  **Local Data Segment Analysis (step2_local):** All local data segments also show a consistent value of '0'. There are no continuous low or high values when compared to the normal data sequence because the entire sequence is uniform. The `param1` value never deviates from '0' for any prolonged duration, nor does it appear to be below or above any implied normal threshold, as '0' appears to be the expected operating value for this sensor under the observed conditions.\n",

No data point or sequence of points exhibit characteristics of an anomaly as defined by consecutive anomalous points, abrupt changes, or prolonged deviations from an anticipated norm.
